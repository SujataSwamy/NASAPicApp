Nasa Pictures App

This is an Android app that will let the user browse through a list of images parsed from a JSON file.

This app contains two screens 

1. Images Grid Screen

This is the home screen. When it launches we show a scrollable grid of pictures starting with the latest images first. When the user taps on an image we show the image detail screen. 

2. Image Detail Screen

This screen displays the full size image along with the metadata like title, description, etc. It also allows user to swipe through images.
